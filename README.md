"# discord_bot_check_timing_user" 

This is a project made for discord.
This is how it receives the login and logout information of users and creates a file based on their name and puts their data in it.
Using the defined commands, you can check how much time each person has spent.

A section is also defined for deleting existing messages in Discord and deleting linked messages.

To give access to delete messages or send links, a desired role must be given to the person, otherwise you will be faced with a warning.
